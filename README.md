# CodeAlpha_MusicPlayer_Project3_HimanshuGhosh

This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring an engaging user interface that allows users to play their favorite songs with ease. The music player is designed with a vibrant, dynamically moving gradient background that changes according to the song's energy and vibes. Additionally, a CD animation moves backward while the music plays and pauses gracefully when the song is stopped.
